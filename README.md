This is a web development project started on 4/11/2025 using backend and frontend programming languages and libraries. Most of the functionalities I coded locally but then created a repo to store them here.
This allows multiple operations:
1. Registering a user and a store account
2. Adding items to carts and putting orders in
3. Seeing stores, categories and products list
4. And many more...

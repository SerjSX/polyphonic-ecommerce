This is a web development project started on 4/11/2025 using backend and frontend programming languages and libraries. Most of the functionalities I coded locally but then created a repo to store them here.
This allows multiple operations:
1. Registering a user and a store account
2. Adding items to carts and putting orders in
3. Seeing stores, categories and products list
4. And many more...

### Primary languages used
1. HTML
2. CSS w/tailwind
3. JavaScript w/jQuery
4. NodeJS, expressJS
5. MongoDB

### Note
The .env file is not included as it has confidential links and access keys, so you won't be able to run the program properly with the source code.
